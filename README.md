# Java-Stream-API-Implementation

A small Java project that implements the following requirements:
- Read the attached file minions.csv using the Java Stream API.
- Remove any duplicate entries from the data.
- Print all items with "# of Eyes" = 1 to the console (in alphabetic order by "Name").
- Save all items (without duplicates and regardless of "# of Eyes") to a new file. This file should be sorted in descending alphabetic order
by "Name", but with "# of Eyes" = 1 coming last in the same sorting as the rest.
